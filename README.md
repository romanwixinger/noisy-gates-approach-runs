# Data and execution code for the Noisy gates approach
Code to reproduce the hardware runs and simulations made for the paper 
"A novel approach to noisy gates for simulating quantum computers". 


## Installation
Clone this repository and make sure that you have Python 3.9 installed. Navigate to the repository and create a virtual 
environment with 'python -m venv ng-env' where we named the environment 'ng-env'. Depending on the OS you are using, the
command for activating the virtual environment differs. In Linux, we use 'source ng-env/bin/activate'. Last, you install 
all dependencies with 'pip install --user .'. Now you are ready to run the main scripts.
